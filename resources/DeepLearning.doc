Okay, the user wants to recreate their Java Spring Boot Pokemon application in Python. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, in the Java code, they have a controller, BLL, DAL, and Infra layer. The Infra layer makes a REST call to PokeAPI, processes the JSON response, and creates a PokemonResponse object. The DAL and BLL seem to just pass through the data, which might be a bit redundant, but maybe they want to keep the structure similar.

So in Python, I should replicate this structure but using Flask or FastAPI for the web framework. Let's go with FastAPI since it's modern and efficient.

Starting with the infrastructure layer. The PokemonInfra in Java uses RestTemplate. In Python, I can use the requests library. The response is parsed using ObjectMapper and JsonNode. In Python, the json module can parse the response into a dictionary. Then extract name, height, weight, types, and abilities. The types and abilities are nested, so I'll need to loop through the 'types' and 'abilities' arrays and collect the names.

Next, the DAL would call the Infra layer. In Python, that's straightforward by importing the Infra class and calling its method.

The BLL in Java is just passing through, so the Python BLL can do the same. Maybe in the future, business logic can be added here, but for now, it's a passthrough.

The controller in Java is a REST controller. In FastAPI, that translates to a router with GET endpoints. So a router that takes a pokemon name as a path parameter, calls the BLL, which calls DAL, which calls Infra, and returns the PokemonResponse.

For the response model, in Java it's a PokemonResponse class with fields and getters. In Python, a Pydantic model would be perfect because FastAPI uses it to generate JSON schemas. So defining a PokemonResponse model with name, height, weight, types, and abilities as fields.

Wait, the user mentioned creating an object or instance that returns the information. So the Pydantic model will serve as the response object, ensuring that the data is serialized correctly.

Also, need to handle exceptions. In the Java code, they throw a RuntimeException if parsing fails. In Python, I should catch exceptions and maybe raise HTTP exceptions so the API returns proper error messages.

Dependency injection in Java is handled via constructors. In Python, FastAPI's dependency injection system can be used, or just manually instantiate the classes. Since the layers are straightforward, maybe just instantiating them in each layer's constructor. For example, the Infra doesn't have dependencies, DAL depends on Infra, BLL on DAL, and Controller on BLL.

Putting it all together, the main application file initializes FastAPI and includes the router.

Testing with a GET request to /api/pokemon/{name} should return the Pokemon data in the specified format.

So the steps are:

1. Create the Pydantic model for PokemonResponse.

2. Implement the Infra layer using requests.

3. Build DAL, BLL, and Controller (router) layers.

4. Set up FastAPI app and include the router.

5. Add exception handling for API errors and parsing issues.

6. Test with a sample request.

I need to make sure that all the field names match and that the nested JSON structures are parsed correctly. For example, in the 'types' array, each entry has a 'type' object with a 'name'. Similarly for 'abilities'.

Also, in Python, it's common to have modules (files) for each layer. So maybe separate files for infra, dal, bll, and routers.

Let me outline the code structure.

First, the PokemonResponse model in models.py:

from pydantic import BaseModel

from typing import List

class PokemonResponse(BaseModel):

name: str

height: int

weight: int

types: List[str]

abilities: List[str]

Then the infrastructure layer in infra.py:

import requests

from typing import Dict, Any

class PokemonInfra:

def get_pokemon_info(self, name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:

url = f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}"

response = requests.get(url)

response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses

return response.json()

Wait, but the Java code processes the JSON into the specific fields. So the Infra should return a PokemonResponse, but that would require converting the JSON into the model. However, the DAL is supposed to call the Infra. Hmm.

Wait in the Java code, the Infra returns a PokemonResponse object. So in Python, the Infra should return the PokemonResponse Pydantic model. Therefore, the Infra would process the JSON and create an instance of PokemonResponse.

So modifying the Infra:

class PokemonInfra:

def get_pokemon_info(self, name: str):

url = f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}"

response = requests.get(url)

response.raise_for_status()

data = response.json()

name = data['name']

height = data['height']

weight = data['weight']

types = [t['type']['name'] for t in data['types']]

abilities = [a['ability']['name'] for a in data['abilities']]

return PokemonResponse(

name=name,

height=height,

weight=weight,

types=types,

abilities=abilities

)

But wait, this would require importing PokemonResponse from models. Also, need to handle exceptions here. Maybe catch requests exceptions and raise a custom exception.

But the Java code throws a RuntimeException. In Python, perhaps let exceptions propagate and handle them in the controller with FastAPI's exception handlers.

So the Infra class now processes the data and returns the Pydantic model.

Then the DAL would call the Infra:

from .infra import PokemonInfra

from .models import PokemonResponse

class PokemonDAL:

def __init__(self):

self.infra = PokemonInfra()

def fetch_pokemon_data(self, name: str) -> PokemonResponse:

return self.infra.get_pokemon_info(name)

Similarly, BLL:

from .dal import PokemonDAL

from .models import PokemonResponse

class PokemonBLL:

def __init__(self):

self.dal = PokemonDAL()

def get_pokemon_data(self, name: str) -> PokemonResponse:

return self.dal.fetch_pokemon_data(name)

Then the controller (router) using FastAPI:

from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException

from .bll import PokemonBLL

from .models import PokemonResponse

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/pokemon", tags=["pokemon"])

bll = PokemonBLL()

@router.get("/{name}", response_model=PokemonResponse)

def get_pokemon(name: str):

try:

return bll.get_pokemon_data(name)

except requests.HTTPError as e:

raise HTTPException(status_code=e.response.status_code, detail="Pokemon not found")

except Exception as e:

raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

Wait, but the Infra uses requests.get, which can raise HTTPError. So in the Infra, when response.raise_for_status() is called, if the status is 404, it will raise an HTTPError. This exception needs to be caught somewhere. In the Java code, they just throw a RuntimeException, which probably results in a 500 error. But in Python, it's better to handle it in the controller to return a 404 if the Pokemon is not found.

So in the router function, wrapping the call in a try-except block that catches requests.HTTPError (which is raised by response.raise_for_status()), and translates it into an HTTPException with appropriate status code.

But to do that, the router needs to import requests, which is only used in the Infra. Alternatively, let the exceptions bubble up. However, the Infra's get_pokemon_info method could raise requests.HTTPError if the API call fails. So in the router, catch that and convert to HTTPException.

Alternatively, handle the HTTP errors in the Infra and return None or something, but that's not as clean. Letting the exception propagate is better, but then the router needs to know about requests exceptions, which couples the layers. Maybe better to catch it in the Infra and raise a custom exception, then handle that in the router. But for simplicity, given time constraints, maybe just handle it in the router.

Wait, in the code above, the Infra's get_pokemon_info calls response.raise_for_status(), which raises an HTTPError if the response status is 4xx or 5xx. So when the Infra is called, if the PokeAPI returns 404, this will raise an HTTPError. This exception will propagate up through DAL and BLL to the controller. In the controller's try-except block, we can catch requests.HTTPError and convert it to FastAPI's HTTPException.

But to catch requests.HTTPError in the controller, we need to import requests there. Which is possible. So the router function would have:

import requests

...

@router.get("/{name}", response_model=PokemonResponse)

def get_pokemon(name: str):

try:

return bll.get_pokemon_data(name)

except requests.HTTPError as e:

status_code = e.response.status_code

detail = "Pokemon not found" if status_code == 404 else "Error fetching Pokemon data"

raise HTTPException(status_code=status_code, detail=detail)

except Exception as e:

raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")

This way, if the PokeAPI returns 404, the user gets a 404 with "Pokemon not found". Other errors from the API are passed with their status code.

Now, the main app file would be:

from fastapi import FastAPI

from .routers import pokemon_router

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(pokemon_router.router)

Then, running with uvicorn.

Putting all together, the directory structure would be:

pokemon_app/

├── __init__.py

├── main.py

├── models.py

├── infra.py

├── dal.py

├── bll.py

└── routers/

└── pokemon_router.py

Testing the endpoint with http://localhost:8000/api/pokemon/pikachu should return the Pokemon data.

Wait, but in Python, relative imports can be tricky. For example, in the router, importing from .bll import PokemonBLL assumes that the router is in a module where the bll is in the same package. So proper package structure and imports are important.

Another point: in the Java code, the layers are using constructor injection for dependencies. In the Python code above, each layer instantiates its dependency directly (e.g., BLL instantiates DAL). This tightly couples the layers. For better testability and loose coupling, maybe using dependency injection. But for simplicity, the current approach is acceptable, especially if the user doesn't need testing with mocks.

Alternatively, using dependency injection with FastAPI's Depends. Let me think: FastAPI has a Depends system where you can define dependencies and override them in tests.

For example, the BLL could depend on a DAL interface, and the DAL could depend on an Infra interface. But in Python, it's duck-typed, so as long as the dependencies have the required methods, it's okay.

But perhaps the user just wants a straightforward translation, so the initial approach is okay.

So putting all together:

models.py defines PokemonResponse as a Pydantic model.

infra.py has PokemonInfra with get_pokemon_info that returns the PokemonResponse.

dal.py has PokemonDAL that uses PokemonInfra.

bll.py has PokemonBLL that uses PokemonDAL.

pokemon_router.py has the APIRouter and the GET endpoint, handling exceptions.

main.py creates the FastAPI app and includes the router.

Now, possible issues:

- The Infra's get_pokemon_info could raise exceptions besides HTTPError, like JSON decoding errors. Those should be caught and handled.

In the Java code, they have a try-catch that throws a RuntimeException. In Python, perhaps in the Infra, catch any parsing errors and re-raise as a custom exception. Or let them bubble up and be caught in the router's general Exception handler.

Alternatively, in the Infra:

def get_pokemon_info(self, name: str):

try:

url = f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}"

response = requests.get(url)

response.raise_for_status()

data = response.json()

...

except requests.RequestException as e:

raise  # This will be caught in the router

except KeyError as e:

raise ValueError(f"Missing key in response data: {e}")

except Exception as e:

raise RuntimeError(f"Error fetching Pokemon data: {e}")

Then in the router, catch ValueError and RuntimeError as 500 errors. But maybe it's better to handle all unexpected exceptions as 500.

So the router's try-except will catch any exception, log it, and return an appropriate HTTP status.

Another thing: the Java code returns ResponseEntity<PokemonResponse>, which in Spring Boot is 200 OK if successful. In FastAPI, as long as no exceptions are raised, the endpoint will return 200 OK with the PokemonResponse model.

Testing this with an invalid Pokemon name should return 404.

Also, in the Infra, when building types and abilities, it's possible that the JSON structure changes. So the code assumes that each 'type' has a 'type' object with 'name', and similarly for abilities. If the PokeAPI changes, this would break. But that's a general API risk.

In summary, the Python code using FastAPI and Pydantic would replicate the Java structure, with each layer (Infra, DAL, BLL, Controller) handling their responsibilities, and the response model ensuring the correct data structure is returned.
